                                                 Cryptographic Algorithms Represantation 

Represantation of different kind of cryptographic ciphers in Python with explanations and therefore comments for better understanding by everyone.

Inside each cipher file, you will find out both the encryption and the decryption method.

Also, i have tried to explain how each cipher works, the level of security that provide and if it's safe or not.

The ciphers have been written in Python 3.8 and PyCharm.

My purpose is to add more ciphers as time pass with the same quality.

Below, are all the ciphers i have done so far.


* Affine 
* ASCII
* Atbash 
* Binary
* Caesar Cipher the Classic version
* Caesar Cipher - 2 advanced ciphers with different style 
* Caesar Cipher in Greek 
* Encryption of a image
* Morse Code in English - You can hear your text
* Morse Code in Greek 
* ROT 13 
* ROT 47 
* RSA 
* Vernam Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher
