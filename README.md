                                     Cryptographic Algorithms Representation 

Representation of different kind of cryptographic ciphers in Python with explanations and therefore comments for better understanding by everyone.

Inside each cipher file, you will find out both the encryption and the decryption method.

Also, i have tried to explain how each cipher works, the level of security that provide and if it's safe or not.

The ciphers have been written in Python 3.8 and PyCharm 2020.3.5.

My purpose is to add more ciphers as time pass with the same quality.

Below, are all the ciphers i have done so far, but my purpose is to do more in the near future.
